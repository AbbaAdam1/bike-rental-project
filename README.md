# Optimizing Bike Share Operations Through Data Analytics

This project explores how weather, seasonality, and demand patterns impact daily bike rentals.  
Using the [UCI Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset), I applied data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover insights that can guide operational decision-making for bike share programs.

# Project Overview
- **Goal:** Identify factors that influence bike rentals and define optimal conditions for operations.
- **Dataset:** UCI Bike Sharing Dataset (daily records: weather, season, and rental counts).
- **Key Steps:**
	1. Clean corrupted dataset (duplicates, NaNs, outliers, invalid strings).
	2. Explore relationships between features (temperature, humidity, weather situation).
	3. Visualize findings with Python (matplotlib, seaborn).
	4. Highlight operational insights (e.g., "Goldilocks zone" for temperature).
